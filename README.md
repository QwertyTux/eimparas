### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
> im a Undergraduate Student at the School of Electrical Engineering of the
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece.

Ive worked on varius electronic projects using the AVR based arduino 
some noteable examples are the following:
* [Controler for JBC T245-C handles](https://github.com/finos2/DIY-JBC-soldering-station) 
* [DIY macro keyboard for gaming](https://github.com/finos2/MacroPad)

> In 2019 i tried my own spin in creating a Function generator, but lack of time made it imposibe to finish
* [Arduino Function Generator](https://github.com/finos2/Arduino-Function-Generator)

> Huge part of my Work was and is centered around UAVs and other aerial flying platfoms. I got my A1/A2 Licence back in 2020 from the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority and in 2021 i fully upgraded to meet the EASA standards plus adding licencies for night flight and high TOW unmanned aircraft. 

here are some noteable projects that helped with the drones ..

- [Runcam Pixhawk Bridge](https://github.com/finos2/Pixhawk-RuncamDevice)
- ["toshiba" LED to ws2801 driver](https://github.com/finos2/PixHawk-i2c-to-Ws2801-bridge)

these both were created before ArduPilot added support ... _perhaps they got inspiration ?_
