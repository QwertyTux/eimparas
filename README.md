Good afternoon, please forgive me for addressing you this way, I saw you writing on the cisco forum about how you managed to connect the CP-7841-NK 9 model to Asterisk/freepbx.

Link to the forum page: https://community .freepbx.org/t/cisco-cp7841-help-me-register-a-cisco-only-phone-to-asterisk/93748

Could you provide more detailed information about how exactly you managed to do this?
(Thanks in advance) 
Earlier, I sent you an email from this mailbox: qwertyTux@hotmail.com

I am a student, and now, while working on my project, I am faced with the same problem. In search of a solution, I came across your discussion on the forum.
