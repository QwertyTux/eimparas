### Hi there 👋

Undergraduate student at the School of Electrical Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece 🇬🇷.

Passionate about embedded systems, electronics, networks, and UAVs. I've worked on a variety of hands-on projects—ranging from soldering stations to drone hardware integrations. 

My interests also include network architecture, especially at the physical layer and in the design of core or access network infrastructures. I enjoy working on network management systems—focusing on how traffic is handled, monitored, and routed efficiently across complex systems, rather than protocol-level work like TCP/UDP or cybersecurity.

## 🔧 Electronics & Microcontrollers

Projects revolve around AVR-based Arduino systems. A few highlights:

- 🔥 [Controller for JBC T245-C handles](https://github.com/eimparas/DIY-JBC-soldering-station) – A DIY soldering station for professional handles.
- 🎮 [MacroPad – Custom Gaming Keyboard](https://github.com/eimparas/MacroPad) – A programmable keypad for gaming and productivity.
- 🔌 [Electronic DC Load](https://github.com/eimparas/Electronic-DC-Load) – An Arduino-controlled DC load for PSU testing and battery characterization.

In 2019, I started building a function generator from scratch. Though it remains unfinished due to university demands, it turned into a valuable learning experience in analog electronics:

## ✈️ UAVs & Aerial Systems

Drones and aerial platforms are a key focus of my work. I earned an A1/A2 UAV pilot license in 2020 from the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority and upgraded to full EASA standards in 2021—including night flight and High TWO(TakeOf waight) UAV certifications.

Some relevant projects:

- 📷 [Runcam–Pixhawk Bridge](https://github.com/eimparas/Pixhawk-RuncamDevice) – Integrating Runcam cameras with Pixhawk flight controllers.
- 🌈 ["Toshiba" LED to WS2801 Driver](https://github.com/eimparas/PixHawk-i2c-to-Ws2801-bridge) – Emulating Toshiba LEDs on PixHawk controllers to drive WS2801 LEDs.

## 🌐 Networking Projects

Fascinated by the design of physical network layers and large-scale infrastructure. I’m especially drawn to access/core network architecture and systems that manage and route network traffic. Less interested in the protocol stack or cybersecurity, more into how everything physically connects and communicates behind the scenes.

One project designed for my homelab:

- 🧠 [TR069-Bot](https://github.com/eimparas/TR069-Bot)

Named after the TR-069 protocol used by ISPs as a tongue-in-cheek reference. The project hooks into CPEs using various techniques, extracts diagnostics, and reports them back to my NoC.

## 🎥 Beyond Tech

Outside of engineering, I enjoy photography and cinematography—especially capturing tech projects, aerial footage, and i especialy like shooting portraits. 
These skills often come in handy when documenting hardware builds or showcasing drone flights.

## Let's Connect!

Always open to collaboration and conversation—especially around electronics, drones, and network design.
